# Cryptography
Implementation of various cryptographic schemes

## Purpose
This is repository contains my implementations of some of the cryptographic schemes I come accross as I read [An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography](https://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/MathCryptoHome.html). These are by no means professional, secure implementations of the schemes, but are instead, proofs of concepts.

## Requirements
[C++ Big Integer Library](https://mattmccutchen.net/bigint/)
